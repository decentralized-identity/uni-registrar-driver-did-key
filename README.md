# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

Installing dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the server at http://localhost:9080, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:9080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

### Building and running the Docker container

Building the container an tagging it by the name of *`universalregistrar/driver-did-key`*:
``` 
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t universalregistrar/driver-did-key .
```
Running the container on port `9084`:
```

```
